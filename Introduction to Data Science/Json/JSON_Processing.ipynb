      "Reviews [{'ReviewID': 'UR156778698', 'Content': 'Location! Location! Location! My stay at the Hotel Axial last month was delightful. I chose this hotel because my daughter鈥檚 university apartment was just steps away, but Trip Advisor reviews sealed the deal. The internet special rate allowed me a double room for the price of a single (Sweet!) for my week long stay. My room was spacious and comfortable, the bathroom sparkled, and I always felt safe. The breakfast room was cheerful with great coffee and nice choice of items, free computer/printer room was open all day, and a small coffee/wine bar was available until the front desk closed after midnight. The location was perfect; two blocks from everything, including The Duomo, which became my homing device. It was impossible to lose my way back. The train station, outdoor market, river, museums, restaurants and the best gelato in Italy, Grom, (Trust me on this!) were an easy walk from the hotel. The hotel鈥檚 staff and front desk, especially Paul, are excellent 鈥?never intrusive but always there to offer gracious assistance with a smile. When, not if, I return to Florence, I will definitely book the Hotel Axial.', 'Ratings': {'Value': '4', 'Overall': '5', 'Cleanliness': '5', 'Service': '5', 'Check in / front desk': '5', 'Location': '5', 'Business service': '5', 'Rooms': '4'}, 'Date': 'Dec 13, 2008', 'Author': 'ginginps'}, {'ReviewID': 'UR379533921', 'Content': 'Great hotel Family run hotel.

It is located on a street where no cars are generally permitted, literally 3 minutes away by foot from the magnificiant Duomo. The whole hotel is located on the second story of a building which is easy to miss if you are not looking out for it.The hotel itself is very clean. The room we stayed in was fairly large, clean and had a nice view of the main street. It also contained a mini fridge. Service at the front desk was exceptionally friendly and professional. The staff were very helpful with tips for visiting Florence and restaurant recommendations. The breakfasts were simple but fairly good. There is a reading room and a free Internet cafe which was useful. There is even a small garden in the back where you can relax. Bottled water is sold at the hotel at a very reasonable price ... no need to carry it from the store. Our only complaint was that the air conditioning in the room we stayed in was very weak and the staff unfortunately could not make it more powerful ... on very hot and humid days like the 2 nights we spent in June, it was a little uncomfortable.We booked our stay by e-mail directly with the hotel. Prior to booking I was amazed at how all of my e-mail inquiries were accurately and professionally responded to within minutes, regardless of the time of day or night. This certainly gave me the confidence that service in this establishment was of a superior quality. Note that if you pay by cash upon check-out, there is a 5% discount. Most of Florence can be visited by foot if you enjoy and are up to walking and the central location of this hotel is ideal. We found the prices in general in Florence very expensive, surprisingly more than in Rome. Overall, although I enjoyed my stay in Florence, I was a little disappointed as I found it too touristy and I much preferred Rome. My girlfirend, on the other hand, who had already visited both Rome and Florence previously, loves Florence for its charm and magic.In a city that is exceptionally expensive, the price we paid at the Hotel Axial was very reasonable. For the price, this hotel is an exceptional value and we have no hesitations whatsoever in recommending it.', 'Ratings': {'Value': '4', 'Overall': '4', 'Cleanliness': '4', 'Service': '4', 'Check in / front desk': '5', 'Location': '5', 'Business service': '3', 'Rooms': '3'}, 'Date': 'Oct 19, 2008', 'Author': 'Tobster2'}, {'ReviewID': 'UR686672298', 'Content': 'In the middle of Florence Stay at Axial, 2 min from the Duomo, in the middle of the city.You can put on your walking shoes and reach everything of interest from there.

DO NOT make any phone calls from the internet room! i was told it was ok by one staff member, but that i would need to settle my phone bill from that room in the morning as she did not know how to obtain records from that phone. as i was instructed, i returned to the front desk in the morning to pay my bill, only to be literally shouted at by a woman with long dark hair who told me i was 'playing tricks on her' and that 'you americans are always sneaking around and trying to get things for free'... apparently she too did not know how to obtain records from the internet room phone, thus not knowing how much to charge. i repeatedly apologized and told her i could tell her which numbers i had called and approx. how much time i had used and that i would pay her double whatever she thought the estimate would be. she continued to literally yell at me and say that 'it is all lost! i have no idea how much! forget it!' well, what do they eventually figure out? how much i owed of course... if you want rude and incompetent service and to sleep in a puddle of your own melted self, then stay here. otherwise, seek shelter elsewhere!\", 'Ratings': {'Value': '1', 'Overall': '1', 'Cleanliness': '2', 'Service': '1', 'Check in / front desk': '1', 'Location': '5', 'Business service': '3', 'Rooms': '1'}, 'Date': 'Jun 3, 2008', 'Author': 'breakoutofthebox911'}, {'ReviewID': 'UR760730793', 'Content': \"Great value and location The Hotel Axial was very basic but spacious, clean, and comfortable.

Our experience at the Hotel Axial in early December was wonderful! The staff was always going out of their way to be pleasant and helpful with whatever we needed.

Our room was ready well before the usual check in time. Our spotless double room was simply furnished but had plenty of space and was full of the little details that make the vacation just that much more memorable. We looked out onto the busy Via Calzaiuoli, filled day and evening with busy Christmas shoppers but when we wanted quiet the updated windows kept out most of the noises all night. If you need NO noise at night, ask for a room on the internal courtyard. Our bed was really comfortable. The shower had great water pressure and we always had plenty of hot hot water--and full size towels. A roomy armoire with plenty of hangers, a safe and handy hooks on the wall by the entrance for overcoats. The location is central to just about anywhere you want to go--and makes it easy to pop back up to the room to drop off purchases, (this IS Florence--you must have purchases!), make a change of clothes or shoes, or even catch a quick nap before heading back out to enjoy the evening.The standard Italian breakfast was set up nicely and was always fresh, with the friendly staff available, if needed.

Although the church bells at 7:00 am will wake you any way....Of the hotels we stayed in Italy, the Hotel Axial was the only one that had an actual breakfast room. Breakfast was help yourself and consisted of cornetto, breakfast pastry, yogurt, cheese, cereal and juice.The Hotel Axial also had a room with two computers with free Internet access. This was a great bonus if we wanted to do some research, etc.As we didn't spend as much time at the Hotel Axial, I don't have too much to say. Although the furnishings were simple and somewhat dates, the room was spacious and clean. The shower in the bathroom was large and always had plenty of hot water.The front desk recommended two restaurants Il Marione and Il Latini. Of the two, I liked Il Marione. Their ribollita was the best of all the versions I had in Florence. Their Bisteca Fiorentina was also the best bargin - the 600 g minimum for one person is more than plenty for two people to share. Il Latini was more of an experience. There will invariably be a huge crowd waiting to get in, but somehow everyone is seated and satisfied. No menus, just lots of food - meat, meat and more meat!I'd recommend the Hotel Axial to anyone looking for a very reasonablly priced (I think our room was 70 Euros per night) comfortable, centrally located hotel in Florence.\", 'Ratings': {'Value': '4', 'Overall': '4', 'Cleanliness': '4', 'Service': '4', 'Check in / front desk': '4', 'Location': '5', 'Business service': '5', 'Rooms': '3'}, 'Date': 'Dec 9, 2007', 'Author': 'pacifica_gal'}, {'ReviewID': 'UR593579217', 'Content': 'Ideal hotel for a short break Small hotel in the centre of the city.

The location couldn't be better, situated as it is about halfway between the Duomo and the Piazza della Signoria on the via dei Calzaiuoli, and just a few steps away from the Orsanmichele church. This makes it the ideal base for anything you want to do in Florence - sightseeing, visiting galleries, museums, etc. It's also within easy walking distance of the train and bus stations. Via dei Calzaiuoli is a busy shopping street and is only a short distance from other markets, such as the leather goods market. It's also surrounded by lots of restaurants, pizzerias and trattorias - so finding somewhere to dine out in the evening is not a problem.The hotel Axial is on the first floor of the building. The rooms are clean, comfortable and a good size, considering the hotel's location in the centre of Florence. The breakfast is good - typically continental: fresh bread rolls  croissants, cereals, coffee, tea and so on. The staff couldn't be friendlier and more helpful. The reception closes at 1a.m., which was a concern to me as I knew I wouldn't be arriving in Florence until after that. But, there was someone there to welcome me and check me in when I did finally arrive at 1.45a.m. There's also a courtyard where you can sit in the evening, as well as free internet access (very useful!). And, they will hold your luggage for you after you check out, if you want to do some last-minute shopping, or enjoy a final stroll to the Duomo, or to the Ponte Vecchio.Again, I highly recommend the Hotel Axial and its super-friendly staff for any visitor to Florence.

The windows must be new because they completely blocked out all sound but also opened easily to get in fresh air.

I don't know if it's any quieter on the other side of the hotel but with trams dinging, and cars honking right outside the window, it must be better than this.

(They were right!) We selected this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and the hotel's website. All were accurate and on-the-mark. Thanks to previous reviewers. The only negative was a front desk recommendation to have dinner at New Galata Restaurant. The meal was shockingly expensive when the waiter failed to report the price of the whole fish we had chosen. The New Galata manager, Mr. Yunes, later explained that it was a mistake that the waiter had not told us the price of the fish after it had been weighed in the back. We hope others do not encounter the same problem. The Amisos might want to reconsider its enthusiastic endorsement of New Galata.

The Amisos hotel is centrally located, very close to the Aya Sophia and the Yerebatan cistern. Unfortunately it is situated just above a very busy tram stop, although the combination of double glazing and air-conditioning makes this bearable. More serious is the sound of pounding Europop from the Irish bar downstairs. We arrived with our baby, and had been promised a cot by the manager when we booked. We were shown to our first floor room, which was large with a good sized bathroom, although the dark decoration made it look a little dingy. Nevertheless, all seemed well until we tried to put the baby to sleep in the cot, which promptly collapsed (without the baby in it, luckily). The key part must have been broken when the hotel had put it up, but the person who had done this had just bodged it together in the vain hope that we would not notice. After some delay and several vociferous protests to reception, we were given a mattress for the baby to sleep on. However, she did not sleep for long because of the noise coming from downstairs. By two o\\'clock in the morning, the complaints from other residents about our baby\\'s screaming persuaded the general manager to upgrade us to the Topkapi Suite on the top floor. This was spacious and quiet, and, inexplicably, had its own sauna. It seemed the kind of place where an \"international businessman\" might entertain a female friend he had met at the nearby ferry terminal. Moreover, there is no way that it was worth the rack rate of well over â‚¬300. The breakfast, I have to say, was truly excellent, and, bleary eyed, we enjoyed the lovely views of the Topkapi gardens.

There appear to be a number of faults, namely the bait and switch, whereby you book a hotel and upon arrival they advise you, the hotel is overbooked and they can put you up in an alternative sister hotel. Best way to avoid this is to arrive early or book a hotel that doesn't seem to do this, the Amisos is in such a bracket. We had two excellent rooms set aside for us as per our pre-booked and paid for arrangements. A second issue with hotels in istanbul is this terrace view, in this instance the terrace view is pretty average. No TV antennae but no view of mosques or aya sofia. you do have an uninteruppted view out the window though which is nice. Also quite cool are the plush chairs and tables made from old singer sewing machines. The location of the Amisos Hotel is superb. Its right next to the Topkapi Palace, very handy. There is a pub downstairs that shows all sorts of Football, F1, Rugby etc. Again very handy and the beer is reasonable. Don't be put off by this either, its hardly a rowdy pub. The opposite in fact. The rooms are fantastical. The website does do the rooms justice for once. Although I have to say the air condition leaves a little to be desired. Shame really as it is the major failing of the Hotel. If you could jam a card in the room key slot to keep the aircon going all day then it would be ok, otherwise its going to get very hot in the middle of summer. All said though, booking a hotel in Istanbul is a depressing excercise, for every good review there is a bad one.

We (late 30s couple, used to traveling) chose this hotel because it was slightly cheaper than others in the area at the time I booked. I knew we\\'d made a mistake when we turned up! The reception area was small, chaotic and unwelcoming. The guy checking us in wanted our 3 nights\\' fee up front (before we had seen the room) and because we were early we needed to leave our bags there but had no choice but to leave them in the open \"reception\" area. When we finally saw our room I wanted to run away! Tiny attic room at the top, broken window catch so we couldn\\'t close it or open it properly (in winter), tiny, lumpy bed crammed into an awkward corner, sheets smaller than the mattress, nasty white stains on spare blanket (!), hair all over the carpet, cigarette butts in the gutter by the window, on a main road so incredibly noisy. Maybe we got the worst room - but it was just depressing. Not helped by the noisy (very dodgy) group of men staying in the room next to ours. Bathroom was tiny but clean.

It's four stars for me or nothing at all. But when I needed a bolt-hole for two nights while I waited between flights at London Heathrow, I reluctantly checked into the Metro Hotel. I expected, for £40 per night, it to be a backpackers hovel, an unclean, cess-pit where I'd spend sleepless nights listening to Polish gangsters carving up a prostitutes body in the room next door. Instead, I was absolutely charmed by the whole place. And while I expected to be bringing my own black light to any joint in Zone 1 of London for that price, the room was.....nice. Clean. With a nice turned down bed. A sink. I opened the french windows and there was a small balcony overlooking a charming stretch of West London street- I watched the black taxis zoom past, in the pouring rain, quietly falling in love with the city I left over a year ago- a city I grew up in. Was it melancholy speaking? I started to love this hotel. How else can you get a key to your own front door in central London for that place. I've paid more in rent for worse flat shares. The staff were friendly guys. The breakfast was delivered to my door, and included in the price. No prostitutes were murdered during my entire stay. And I actually missed the place when I checked out. I mean, you couldn't bring a girl back here, if you met one in, perhaps one of the nice bars nearby. She might be horrified at the communal bathroom. But if like me you need a small room to pass the 46 hour wait for a plane....Ask for room two. Nice room.

Let me start by saying that the location is great, Only 5 minutes away from London Paddington, a very safe area for any experience travellers or first timers in London. London paddington connects you to any cross-country train and since I was coming from Wales this was perfect for me. Paddington also connects you with the tube [Bakerloo line] (subway system in London), and that will take you anywhere in London zone 1 though 6. The overall cleanness of the room and bathroom was very good. The rooms are small but quite sufficient for the basic needs. If you are planning to spend a lot of time in your room (which I wouldn't imaging the reason), you might as well try a different hotel with more spacious rooms. The staff was very friendly and helpful, so not complaints at all. My departure plans were at 4:30am, so the night before one of the members of staff brought me breakfast which i thought it was very nice of him.The breakfast was highly appreciated specially by an empty stomach in the early morning. (a juice box, crackers, sweet bread filled with chocolate, a bread roll, butter, jam, and a yogurt) There is a Television set in the room and a small refrigerator which comes very handy when you want to keep snack and cold water. This hotel doesn't have a lift, so if your room is on the top floor, you are going to be exhausted by the time you reach it. specially if you are bringing heavy suitcases with you. The Wi-Fi is non-existent on the top floors and in the lobby my computer couldn't connect to the router, so that was a complete failure.

It's more like a real hotel, where you can actually sleep if you want. They bring you breakfast in your room every morning: that's soooo cool!

The hotel is basic, but it never pretends to be anything more than a budget option and for us it was exactly what we needed - a cheap and convenient place to stay after a night out in central London. The location is excellent, barely a minute's walk from Paddington station, and it was convienience and price that attracted us to book here. First impressions were a little off-putting - a narrow staircase up to a tiny reception area that was crowded with luggage and piles of towels - and the place does look a little rough around the edges, but our room was clean and tidy and we were pleasantly surprised by how nice the bathroom was. The room was definitely very small - the bed was right up against the window on the one side and only a yard from the wall on the other, so we only had a little bit of space at the foot of the bed and outside the bathroom where we could put our bags. We also had a small bedside table, a wardrobe with a safe inside, a mini-fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, a TV that made an annoying buzzing sound when it was turned on and a broken chair! I definitely wouldn't recommend the place to travellers staying longer than one or two nights or planning to spend some time relaxing in the room, but all we wanted was a place to leave our bags, change to go out and sleep when we came back in, and for that it was fine. The mattress and pillows were comfy and we had a good night's sleep, although perhaps light sleepers might not fare so well as the road outside was pretty busy and you can hear passing trains from time to time. In the morning we were given a breakfast tray (which can be brought to you any time between 8am and 10am) - it was a simple collection of pre-packed items (yoghurt, juice, bread, mini-croissants and biscuits) but was nice enough and saved us having to go out and buy something. At check out we were able to leave bags free of charge to collect later, which was really helpful - although they were just left in the corridor by reception so I wouldn't recommend this for valuables. All in all, I'd recommend this place to any travellers on a budget who just want somewhere to crash for a couple of nights, but if you're looking for a longer stay or hoping to spend some time relaxing in your hotel room then I think the small size of the rooms would really annoy you and it's probably worth spending a bit more for a nicer, more spacious room elsewhere. And it's definitely a good option for young people on a night out in central London - it was really easy to get in to Soho on the tube and back on the night bus, and the room keys allow you to let yourself in to the hotel 24/7.\", 'AuthorLocation': 'W Yorkshire', 'Date': 'October 3, 2010', 'Author': 'lmm50'}, {'Ratings': {'Value': '1', 'Overall': '1.0', 'Cleanliness': '2', 'Sleep Quality': '1', 'Location': '4', 'Service': '2', 'Rooms': '1'}, 'Title': \"“don't stay here”\", 'ReviewID': 'UR81745327', 'Content': 'dramatic, but wish someone had listed this before we booked. there are definitely better places around for not too much more, the stairs are killers, the guy at desk is nice and all but the room is barely bigger than a wardrobe and the \"double\" we booked was a large single at best. clean ensuite but the bedroom absolutely not suitable for 2 adults to stay in, great location but there\\'s heaps of other little hotels in the area.', 'AuthorLocation': 'Perth, Australia', 'Date': 'October 1, 2010', 'Author': 'bintravln'}, {'Ratings': {'Value': '5', 'Overall': '5.0', 'Cleanliness': '4', 'Sleep Quality': '5', 'Location': '5', 'Service': '5', 'Rooms': '4'}, 'Title': '“Nice hotel close to center and transportation”', 'ReviewID': 'UR80793429', 'Content': 'Nice, cheap, quite clean.

There is a lovely shisha cafe on the roof and an inviting swimming pool. The breakfast buffet was ample with all the Arab specialities, plus some Western titbits like beef bacon, French toast and baked beans.

They brought it a full size mattress to put on the floor for my 14 year old son. The living room was plenty big enough for both. There were 2 tvs which is always good with teens. The washer was broken so they did the wash for us. There is a grocery within a 10 min walk. They have a tour desk but we found the prices were slightly better through another company. We booked the desert safari because it was recommended by another traveler on Trip Advisor. It was ok but there was a lot of down time. We left at 3:30 & were at the site by 5 (after sand drifting & driving out there). Dinner didn\\'t start till 7:30 which gave us plenty of time for the camel rides, sand skiing, henna, etc. (4 wheeling was an extra charge but everything else was included except alcohol) But I would have preferred less \"sitting around\" time.', 'AuthorLocation': 'San Antonio, Texas', 'Date': 'December 26, 2007', 'Author': 'retired43'}]\n",

We were really tired but didnt make a fuss. When we got to our apartment it was the wrong one as we had expected four beds as there was four of us. We could not be bothered to complain as we were so tired we just wanted to crash. Overall I was quite happy with the room as it was close to las ramblas and lots of shops and restaurants open till late which was ideal as we were on a stag do so we were out most of the time.There was a lot of noise from outside but didnt bother us much as we were up till late anyway. We had a tv that we couldnt work but apart from that the room was fine. The kitchen was a big plus as it meant we could make our own tea (very british I know). The shower didnt give us much warm water but didnt mind as it was so warm during our visit. The best thing about the apartment is location. If you go in expecting luxury then you will be dissapointed. Its basic but what we needed which was a place to sleep. If your young and don't mind noise and slumming it a bit then its ideal. I didnt not like the lady that was a cleaner because she was a bit moody but thats it. Wouldnt reccommend for families or elderly as the area is loud even up until 5 am. The area stinks a bit but it was fine.\", 'AuthorLocation': 'Birmingham, United Kingdom', 'Date': 'July 31, 2010', 'Author': 'brummiee'}, {'Ratings': {'Value': '5', 'Overall': '4.0', 'Cleanliness': '4', 'Service': '3', 'Location': '5', 'Rooms': '4'}, 'Title': '“Basic, Close,Fun, Clean”', 'ReviewID': 'UR38284646', 'Content': \"I thought this set of apartments ticked all the right boxes, nothing dirty, cheap, basic and with a good set of people staying in it.

A TV ( Spanish channels only) and small sterio system was also provided in the room along with some additional bedding , blankets etc. The appartments appear quite secure due to a 24hr maned reception area and an additional 2 locked doors before you reach your appartment. There is internet available in the reception area at a rate of 1 euro per hour. On the down side is that the road the apartments are located on could only be described as 'Very dodgy' after dark, plenty of people hanging around street corners up to no good and the road is very noisy with local drunks shouting and yelling until 5AM, this didnt bother me too much as I was pretty mashed myself but i could not recommend this place for the elderly, lone female travelers or familys.\", 'AuthorLocation': 'Southern UK', 'Date': 'March 20, 2009', 'Author': 'Johnboyno1'}, {'Ratings': {'Value': '3', 'Overall': '3.0', 'Business service (e.g., internet access)': '1', 'Cleanliness': '2', 'Service': '2', 'Check in / front desk': '3', 'Location': '3', 'Rooms': '2'}, 'Title': '“Cheap but basic.”', 'ReviewID': 'UR14031651', 'Content': \"We had an apartment with a bedroom and lounge.

If you're planning to spend most of your time out of the apartement then it's ok. It didn't spoil our visit, but then again it didn't add to the charm or visual experience. If you do book one try and ensure you get one with a Balcony. Not for the view but simply so you can open the door and get some fresh air into the room. For 4 people it could be a bit crowded.
